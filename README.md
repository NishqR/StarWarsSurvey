# StarWarsSurvey
 
My analysis of the Star Wars Survey data from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/

## All graphs and explorations
All the graphs and explorations can be found in the jupyter notebook, just open up starwars.ipynb (can be viewed in github itself). Here's a couple of interesting findings from the jupyter notebook: 

#### How fans rank Star Wars movies

#### Who Shot First?

#### Palpatine's favorability amongst audiences split by their yearly household income

This was done for each major character, and each of the different demographics available in the data. Have a look through the notebook to see more interesting insights. 


## Presentation Slides
There are also presentation slides that explain the methodology for data preparation, and summarize some of the most interesting results from the data exploration and analysis. The full presentation is in presentation_slides.pdf (can be viewed in github itself)
