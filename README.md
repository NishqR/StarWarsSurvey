# StarWarsSurvey
 
My analysis of the Star Wars Survey data from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/

All the graphs and explorations are in the jupyter notebook

There are also presentation slides that add a bit of flair to the presentation of the analysis conducted
